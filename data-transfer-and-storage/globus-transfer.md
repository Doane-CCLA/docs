# Globus Transfers & More

## Globus File Transfers

1. Find the endpoints (on the left **and** right of the screen) you wish to use according to the [endpoints](globus-endpoints.md) instructions.
- Modify the paths to the data you wish to transfer. _For this example, we will move a file from CCLA Lustre storage to a Globus Tutorial endpoint._
- Click and drag files/folders between the two halves of the screen.   


## Additional Features

*  **Create a Folder**: Globus also supports the creation of folders from within the browser interface.   
* **Sharing Endpoints**: You can share endpoints with anyone who has a Globus account. If you are sharing from a managed endpoint (i.e. CCLA OR) he or she will also need to have the proper credentials to access that resource.   
  &#128221; **Note:** Shared endpoints can only be created on personal endpoints if you have a subscription service through Globus. On CCLA resources, shared endpoints may be requested by [contacting the CCLA](../SUPPORT.md).
  * _Sharing a personal endpoint:_
    * Navigate to the endpoint list that is administered by yourself: [here](https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints?scope=administered-by-me).
    * Click on the endpoint you would like to manage.
    * On the resulting screen, click the `My Shares` tab. Then click `+ Add Shared Endpoint`.
    * Fill out the required information.
    * Follow the instructions for configuring the shared endpoint. _For additional information of sharing files and endpoints, see the [Globus documentation](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/share-files/)._
