# HPC Software Configuration

In this section, we discuss the HPC Condos software configuration. Our software environment uses Linux environment [modules](modules.md) to perform this configuration. The software modules available to users also contain preconfigured [compiler toolchains](compilers.md), or programming environments which include parallel compiler wrappers and associated MPI stacks. There are also [workflow tools](workflows.md) that may help with your applications as well.

## Modules

The HPC software environment uses Linux environment modules to manage versions and dependencies of software packages. When you load a module, it sets the environment variables necessary for running your program.

A list of available software modules can be viewed by typing `module avail`.

**Modules: Local repository**<br>
By default the local repository is used as a source of software installations.

Additional information on HPC modules may be found [here](modules.md).
