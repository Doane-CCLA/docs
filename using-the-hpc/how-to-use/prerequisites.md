# Prerequisites

To properly utilize SHPC Condos, you will need a couple of utilities loaded on your local machine. These utilities are free and widely used for this type of application.

* Required: **SSH client**
* Recommended: **Bash terminal**

### MacOS and Linux
Both macOS and Linux distributions include a Bash terminal and an SSH client by default. No additional software should be required to access SHPC Condos.

### Windows Users

Windows does not have a native SSH client or a native Bash terminal. A few solutions are linked below.

* Option 1: [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - SSH client and Bash environment for Windows.
* Option 2: [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) – Part of the Git for Windows environment includes Git Bash, which provides a light weight ssh client.
* Option 3: [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) – If you wish to have Bash-style functions on your Windows machine, then you should consider installing Cygwin, which ports the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) system calls and environment to Windows.
