# Using Jetstream Virtual Machines in your Allocation
### If you need to know how to login to Jetsream through the Atmosphere Graphical User Interface,
### please see the preceeding section: [Accessing Atmosphere on Jetstream](https://github.com/Doane-CCLA/docs/blob/master/using-xsede-resources/accessing-atmosphere-on-jetstream.md)

1. First we will need to log in to https://use.jetstream-cloud.org and navigate to the "Images" page.

2. For this example, we will search for an image with Anaconda 3 installed. Type "anaconda" into the search bar as shown below. Jetstream has a "live" search bar so it will start filtering the VM images as soon as you start typing.

3. If we scroll down the page we will see an image titled "Doane CST210 Ubuntu". This VM image looks like it has everything we need.

4. While we are here, I am going to favorite this VM image by clicking the star in the upper right corner of the VM's panel as shown below. The star should now be filled in with a color.

5. Now, we will scroll to the top of the page and click on the "FAVORITES" button in the VM Images Navigation Menu. This way we can ahve fewer VM images filling up our screen.

6. Once there, we will now click on the "Doane CST210 Ubuntu" vm image panel. Clicking anywhere in the white area of the panel will work.

7. This new page provides detailed information about the selected VM image. This includes previous versions of the VM image and what was changed in each version.

8. If you are happy with the information provided and think this VM will work for your needs, we will need to create a project to actually store and run the VMs related to our project. In the top (main) navigation menu, click on the "Projects" button.
![Clicking on the top navigation menu Projects button](https://github.com/Doane-CCLA/docs/blob/master/images-tutorials/nav-to-projects.png "Click on the top navigation menu Projects button")

9. Once on the projects page, click on the "CREATE NEW PROJECT" button as shown below.
![Clicking on the CREATE NEW PROJECT button](https://github.com/Doane-CCLA/docs/blob/master/images-tutorials/create-new-project-1.png "Click on the CREATE NEW PROJECT button")

10. Now enter a name and description for your new project. Click the "CREATE" button when you are finished.
![Filling information and clicking CREATE](https://github.com/Doane-CCLA/docs/blob/master/images-tutorials/create-new-project-2.png "Fill out the information and click CREATE")

11. Now we have successfully created a new project.
